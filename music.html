        <h1>GENERAL INFO.</h1>
        <p>This page contains a selection of my musical work over the past year or so. I am a guitarist who has been playing for around 1 year and I am currently a member of the band "The Muzzketeers". Our range varies from songs such as "La Grange"
          to "American Idiot" and much more. Below is some audio from my schools spring concert of our year 12 piece "Captain Morgans Revenge".</p>

          <h1>ROCK ACADEMY.</h1>
          <p>During the July holidays I attended a program held in Richmond title Rock Academy Melboure. For one week we would be placed in groups with talented musicians and were to learn a cover song and also write our own original song to perform
          on the Friday night of the week. We performed at the Central Club Hotel in Richmond. The experience was incredible from the extremely talented and friendly nature of the other musicians to the amazing care and tutelage from the mentors.
          I thoroughly recommend the program to other musicians out there. This photo is from my perforance on the Friday next to Phil Ceberano</p>

          <h1>ROCK ACADEMY.</h1>
          <p>Coming up with original song lyrics proved to be a difficult challenge, so drawing on inspiration from the film "The Lion King", we adapted a rock homage to the famous film with lyrical references to the movie.
            This video is our performance of "Can You Feel The Rock Tonight"</p>
